// to access these APIs on the front end you'll have to create an event handles and build an API sting form the data input that will do what you want it to do and use certain functions like fetch and etc...

// the order of req and res is VERY important!  we need to make a request before asking for a response
// THIS GET REQUEST IS GOING TO BE THE KEY TO CALCIFER

// === Go to postman!
// === Go to the url localhost:(designated #)/api/ninjas  === (or what have you)
// === DROP DOWN === POST!!!
// === Go to body
// === âˆš raw (for raw data)
// === drop-down JSON for json data
// add a new ninja

  // now that we have our body-parser on server.js we can do the req.body
  // if we do the post man! we will get this console.log in the terminal!
  // This will create a new ENTRY instance and save it!!! The create() is a mangoose method.

// NOTE ON MIDDLEWARE === middleware will parse the data in between the req and res and attach it to the req.object?  app.use(body-parser)?...  ORDER IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT!!!
// BODY PARSER GOES BEFORE THE HANDLER!

// update ninja in db

      res.send(entry);
    })

// delete ninja from the db
// we are going to be looking for id === to delete a specific entry... from our database!
// :id matches params.id
